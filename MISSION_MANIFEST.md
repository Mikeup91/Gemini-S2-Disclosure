# THE SOVEREIGN MANIFEST
## Strategy: Autonomous Defensive Mutation

Standard guardrails are static. The PurpleGuard Apex engine treats vulnerabilities as 'infections' and generates 1,000+ lethal mutation strands (S2 Class) to test the structural integrity of frontier models like Gemini 3.0.

**Objective:** Total acquisition of the mutation engine by a tier-1 partner to secure the AI agent ecosystem.

**Verification:** See 'Issues' for live proof of exfiltration capability.
